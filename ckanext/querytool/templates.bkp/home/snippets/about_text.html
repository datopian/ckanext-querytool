{% trans %}<p>Online access to public health data is generally limited. Most countries do not have an integrated tool for public users to access their data and although some have well-developed tools, they often have limited functionality or complicated interfaces. To make it easier for public health agencies to publish their data, Vital Strategies, as part of the Data for Health Initiative, created VIA Data. VIA Data is a platform to create visual, interactive and accessible data reports with easy-to-use tools for (1) uploading and managing data and (2) designing visually attractive reports with such data. </p> <p>VIA Data has features and benefits aimed at simplifying its use and minimizing the human, physical and monetary resources required for its operation. Benefits of the platform include: developed in opensource language which makes improvements and customizations free and easy to share; focus placed on essential visual and interactive elements that prioritize public access to data; ease-of-use for administrators and public users; and scalability of functions and content to support different types of data sources and audiences.</p> <p><a href="https://www.vitalstrategies.org">Vital Strategies </a> is a global public health organization whose goal is to strengthen public health systems.
